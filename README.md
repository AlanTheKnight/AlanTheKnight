## Hello everyone! :wave:

My name is Maxim Gusev, I'm 15 and I want to become a programmer when I grow up.  
I love coding on Python :snake:, Django and C++. Also I use Linux :penguin:.  
I'm from :ru: but can speak :uk: with no problems.  

I will keep learning. I'm going to get better at algorithms, learn JS and Vue framework
and become a fullstack developer.

My main project I develop with [@pashs-ba](https://github.com/pashs-ba). It's a digital diary for my
school (system for students to view their marks which are set by teachers & view homework) we decided
to create when we were participating in ["School of IT-solutons"](https://itsolschool.ru/) which took
place in St. Petersburg.
